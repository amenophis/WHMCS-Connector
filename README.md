WHMCS connector for PHP 5.3
===========================
Connect your web applications with WHMCS.

I plan to have version 1.0 compatible with WHMCS version 5.0.3

TO DO
-----
* Add support for helper actions, not all actions relate to a specific data type.
* Implement save & update methods for Entity derived classes, this will need to be done in the templates.
* Create unit test templates for each Entity derived class.
* Impliment field validation via phpdoc to remove the need creating a Type class for each Entity.
* Create schema files for all of wHMCS's data types.
* Improve comments and Documentation.
